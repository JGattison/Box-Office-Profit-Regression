# Box Office Profitability Analysis (2010-2016)

## Overview
This project analyzes key factors that drive the profitability of movies released between **2010 and 2016**. It examines variables such as **budget**, **runtime**, **total votes**, and **IMDB ratings from specific demographics (e.g., female and male voters)** and their impact on movie profits. Additionally, the analysis investigates how the broader box office environment—represented by the **overall gross revenue during the first 4 weeks**—influences individual movie outcomes. Data from **Kaggle** was joined and complemented with movie release dates scraped from Google, and the results were visualized using **Tableau**.

## Objective
To comprehensively analyze the factors driving profitability for movies released from 2010-2016, focusing on how **industry-wide performance (overall gross revenue during the first 4 weeks)**, **audience ratings from men and women**, and **total votes** affect individual movie outcomes. The study also raises important business questions related to competition, audience segmentation, and marketing strategy.

## Data Sources
- **Kaggle - Movie Data Analytics Dataset**: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shahjhanalam/movie-data-analytics-dataset)
- **Kaggle - Weekend Box Office Summaries**: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonbown/weekend-box-office-summaries)
- **Google Scraping**: Used to scrape and integrate release dates for movies, which were combined with the Kaggle datasets to complete the analysis.

## Key Areas of Focus:

### 1. Impact of Overall Box Office Revenue on Individual Movie Profit
**Analysis**: The variable **overall_gross_4weeks** represents the total box office revenue generated by all movies during the first four weeks of release. The model shows a positive and statistically significant relationship between industry-wide performance and individual movie profit.

**Insights**:
- Higher industry-wide revenue in the first four weeks correlates with higher profits for individual films, suggesting that periods of strong box office performance benefit individual movies.

**Business Questions Raised**:
- Does a thriving box office environment lift profits for all movies, or do blockbusters disproportionately benefit?
- How does competition from other high-performing movies during these periods affect mid-tier films?

**Visualization**: The bubble chart below illustrates the relationship between **overall gross revenue** and **individual movie profits**, with bubble sizes representing the total market revenue.

### 2. Effect of Budget on Profit
**Analysis**: **Budget** is shown to have a highly significant positive impact on profitability. The model indicates that for every unit increase in budget, the expected profit increases, suggesting that higher investments generally lead to higher returns.

**Insights**:
- Larger budgets tend to yield higher profits, but strategic budget allocation is crucial, as diminishing returns can occur beyond certain thresholds.

**Business Questions Raised**:
- What is the optimal budget size that maximizes profitability without encountering diminishing returns?
- How should production, marketing, and distribution budgets be optimized to ensure maximum profitability?

**Visualization**: The scatter plot below shows the relationship between **budget** and **profit**, highlighting a clear upward trend.

### 3. IMDB Ratings by Gender (VotesM & VotesF) and Profit
**Analysis**: The model demonstrates that **VotesF** (female ratings on IMDB) is statistically significant and positively impacts profitability, while **VotesM** (male ratings) does not show a strong correlation with profits.

**Insights**:
- Movies that resonate with female audiences tend to perform better at the box office, suggesting that appealing to female viewers is critical for maximizing profits.

**Business Questions Raised**:
- What types of content (e.g., genres, storylines, casting) drive higher ratings from female audiences, and how can studios leverage this information?
- Should marketing strategies target female viewers more aggressively to boost profits?

**Visualization**: The histograms below compare average profit across different **IMDB rating ranges** for both male and female voters, with a noticeable trend for higher profits associated with higher female ratings.

### 4. Total Number of Votes and Profit
**Analysis**: **Total votes** on IMDB showed a positive correlation with profits, although this relationship was not as strong as the effect of budget or female ratings.

**Insights**:
- While audience engagement (measured by total votes) is a positive indicator of box office performance, it seems that quality (e.g., higher ratings) matters more than the sheer volume of votes.

**Business Questions Raised**:
- How does audience engagement on platforms like IMDB translate into word-of-mouth marketing and box office success?
- Should studios prioritize increasing audience reviews or ratings to improve box office outcomes?

**Visualization**: The scatter plot below shows the relationship between **total votes** and **profit**, with a positive trend, though weaker compared to other factors such as budget or female ratings.

## Project Structure:

### 1. Box Office Profitability Model

**Code Snippet**:
```r
# Fit GLM model
model <- glm(profit ~ TotalVotes + Budget + Runtime + MetaCritic + overall_gross_4weeks + num_releases + VotesF, 
             family = gaussian(link = "identity"), data = movie_data)

# Output model summary
summary(model)
```

### 2. Visualization in Tableau
The visualizations for **budget**, **overall gross revenue**, and **IMDB ratings by gender** were created in Tableau. Please refer to the images in this repository for insights.

## Summary and Recommendations:
The analysis of box office performance from **2010 to 2016** highlights several key factors influencing profitability. While **budget** and **female audience engagement (VotesF)** are significant predictors of profit, the broader box office environment (**overall gross market revenue**) also plays a crucial role. These findings raise important questions about **competition**, **audience segmentation**, and **release timing strategies**.

### Insights Summary:
- **Budget** is the most significant predictor of profitability, though it must be managed carefully to avoid overspending.
- **Female viewer engagement (VotesF)** is highly correlated with box office success, suggesting that studios should prioritize content that resonates with this demographic.
- **Overall market performance** impacts individual movie profits, suggesting that release timing and competition should be carefully considered.

### Recommendations:
- **Budget Optimization**: Studios should balance production and marketing budgets to maximize profitability, focusing on high-ROI activities.
- **Target Female Audiences**: Create and market content that appeals to female viewers to increase box office performance.
- **Release Timing**: Plan releases around periods when the overall market is performing well but avoid highly competitive release windows.
